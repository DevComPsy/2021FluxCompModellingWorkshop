# Model recoverability scripts for Flux 2021 Computational Modeling Workshop

To generate simulated choice data:
simulate_choice_data.m

To fit models to data:
fit_simulated_data.m

To plot parameter recoverability:
parameter_recovery.m

To plot model recoverability:
model_recovery.m

Note: The parameter and model recoverability scripts assume that the models used to simulated the choice data and the models used to fit the data were 1.) the same and 2.) run in the same order.
